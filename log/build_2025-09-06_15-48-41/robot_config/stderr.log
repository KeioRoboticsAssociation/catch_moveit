[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstomp_moveit.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "stomp_moveit", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "stomp_moveit" with
  any of the following names:

    stomp_moveitConfig.cmake
    stomp_moveit-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "stomp_moveit" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "stomp_moveit_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "stomp_moveit" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
